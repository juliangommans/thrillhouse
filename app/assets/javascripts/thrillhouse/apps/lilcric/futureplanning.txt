What to do in THE FUTURE???
-----------------------------
* Add modal? or some popup to explain rules at the start and give options (alert after every ball or not, etc.)
* Reafactor sheeeeit
//-- * Vary shot results based on speed. --//
* Add animation/more visual distinction to the batsman.
* Combo shots? (like "down up" for ramp shot)
* Bowling aspect/gameplay, -> might need a reskin (birds eye view) for bowling areas.
